<h3 class="museo_slab_500 t_ds56-2">BOOK DETAILS</h3>
<ul>
	<li id="q5"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q5'); return false;">What are book details?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>Details include the recipe format for your book and any other options desired, such as recipe icons, fillers, recipe notes, index type, etc. The Chairperson sets the book details in the Set-Up Wizard when she creates the account. If you change your mind after seeing the PDF proof the details can easily be changed.</p>
	</div>
	<li id="q6"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q6'); return false;">I want my categories in a different order, or my categories named differently than the list shows. How do I change it?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>To change category names when first setting up the account just highlight the name of the category you wish to change and type the new name. Use the MOVE button and drag and drop to arrange categories in a different order. Click the Add Category button if more categories are needed, or click the minus button to delete categories. </p>
	</div>
	<li id="q7"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q7'); return false;">What is meant by "Order Recipes" in the Design Options?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>You choose the order you wish the recipes to appear in your book. Select "- -" for the recipes to be printed in the same order they are entered. Select "by Alphabet" if you want U-Type-It™ Online to automatically alphabetize the recipes in each category for you. Select "Custom Order" if you want the option of moving recipes within each category.<br />
			You may change from Custom order to Alphabetical at any time. However, please be aware that the recipes will be saved in the order you previously chose so changing from Alphabetical to Custom will necessitate you rearranging the recipes if a different order is desired.</p>

<h3 class="museo_slab_500 t_ds56-2">ADDING RECIPES</h3>
<ul>
	<li id="q8"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q8'); return false;">How do I add a recipe?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>Login with the cookbook credentials provided by your Chairperson and click on "EDIT” next to your order. Select the icon to ADD/EDIT recipes, and the ADD A RECIPE tab. Enter the information, tabbing from field to field. Be sure to preview and proofread your recipe, and give it APPROVED status. Click SAVE when you are finished or, if you have more recipes to enter, click SAVE AND ADD ANOTHER.</p>
	</div>
	<li id="q9"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q9'); return false;">What is Recipe Status?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>Use Recipe Status to identify the progress of each recipe as it is added to your cookbook.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data Entry - the recipe is in the process of being added.</li>
			<li>Editorial - there is a question about the recipe that must be answered before it can be included in the cookbook.</li>
			<li>Inactive - the recipe will not be included in the cookbook.</li>
			<li>Approved - the recipe has been checked and is ready for printing. Only those recipes with APPROVED status will be printed!</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<li id="q10"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q10'); return false;">What are recipe parts?</a></li>

	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>Click the side tab for Recipe Icon or Special Character and select the desired icon or character. Recipe icons will be placed at the end of the recipe title (only one icon per recipe). Special characters will appear wherever the cursor is placed within the recipe. Side tabs may be left open for convenience or closed by clicking the tab name.</p>
	</div>
<li id="q20"><a href="#" onclick="showMe('q20'); return false;">Can I copy/paste from other sources into my U-Type-It&trade; <em>Online</em> account?</a></li>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
		<p>We discourage the use of copy/paste because the results are not predictable. Special characters, in particular, (i.e. bullets, accent marks, etc.) should only be used from the pulldown menu at the right of your screen. If your proof does not return when you submit, it could very likely be an issue with unrecognized special characters.</p>
