		<p>You may add, edit, or remove categories and subcategories using the list below by clicking on the buttons. If recipes have been already entered and changes are made to the categories or subcategories, those recipes must be reassigned to the new category or subcategory in order for them to print. </p>
		<p>Changing the order of appearance of either categories or subcategories will also break the link between the recipe and it's category/subcategory. To repair either circumstance, you must edit each recipe by going to "Review Recipes," then click the "Edit Recipe" link for each recipe and select the new category or subcategory name from the drop-down list.</p>
