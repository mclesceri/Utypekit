		<p>The Co-Chairperson assists the Chairperson with this cookbook order. The Co-Chairperson has many of the same levels of access as the Chairperson for the recipes, but cannot edit member or book details, request a proof, or submit the recipes for printing. You may only assign the Co-Chairperson access level to a person who you have previously set up in the "Review Users" section of the U-Type-It Online software.</p>
