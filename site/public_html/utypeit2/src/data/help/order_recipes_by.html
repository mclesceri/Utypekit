		<p>This selection determines the order in which your recipes will appear in the cookbook. There are three options available:</p>
		<p><b> -- </b><br />
			No selection (or the "null" selection) will make recipes appear in the order in which they were entered, regardless of title, or content.</p>
		<p><b>by Alphabet</b><br />
			The recipes will appear alphabetically ordered according to the first letter of the recipe title. Recipes will be alphabetized within categories and, if you've opted to display subcategories, within subcategory as well.</p>
		<p><b>Custom Order</b><br />
			This option activates a new link at the top of the "Review Recipes" page. The "Organize Recipes" link will allow you to move your recipes around within the category, or subcategory, so that they appear in the book in the order you designate.</p>
