		<p>The pages in your cookbook will be created by our automated pagination system. The recipes can appear on those pages one of two ways; Recipes Continued, or Recipes Not Continued.</p>
		<p><strong>Recipes Continued</strong><br />
			Recipes Continued means that recipes will flow from page to page. Some recipes may be split between two pages, where one part of the recipe is on one page, and the remainder of the recipe will be on the next. This options is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">free</span> with your order and helps you maximize space, and limit the number of pages in the book.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Recipes Not Continued</strong><br />
			Recipes Not Continued means that your recipes will remain on one page. Unless the recipe is inordinately large, no breaks will occur within the recipe, ensuring that the reader will not have to go back and forth between pages to see a single recipe.
