		<p>These options help you set up your U-Type-It&trade; <em>Online</em> account. You may edit these options within the U-Type-It&trade; <em>Online</em> at any time after you have set up your account. If you are unsure about this part of your cookbook, you can skip all these steps and simply move on to the sign-up, or you can <a href="http://dev.cbp.ctcsdev.com/contact">contact us</a> with your questions.</p>
		<p><strong>I want to add more contributors to my order</strong><br />
			This option allows you to add people to this order that can help you organize, edit, or enter recipes. There are different levels of participation, and each level has its own set of permissions. The help (?) buttons on this page of the wizard explain these permissions.

		<p><strong>I want to set up my recipe sections (categories)</strong><br />
