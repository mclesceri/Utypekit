		<p>To organize your recipes, first choose the category (and subcategory if you're using them). When the list appears, use the "up" and "down" arrows to rearrange your recipes. To save the results, click on the "Save" button at the bottom. No changes will be applied until you click the "Save" button.</p>
		<p>NOTE: If you are using subcategories, and you see recipes before you select a subcategory, that means the recipes listed aren't assigned to a subcategory, but are assigned to the category. You can either edit the recipe to include it in the subcategory, or you can leave it as is. If you leave it as is, the recipe will appear, in order, at the beginning of this section in the cookbook.</p>
